    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the computational time an algorithm takes to complete, relative to its input size. A more efficient algorithm typically has a lower time complexity, which makes it perform better for larger inputs.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run, regardless of how long it takes. It is often expressed using Big O notation such as O(n), indicating how memory usage grows with input size.
