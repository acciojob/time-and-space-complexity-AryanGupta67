  <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. Understanding time complexity helps in writing more efficient code that performs better under large data sets.

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. A common example is O(n), which means the memory usage grows linearly with the input. Understanding <b>Space Complexity</b> is essential for optimizing memory usage in applications.
